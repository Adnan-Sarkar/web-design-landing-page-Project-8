# Web Design Landing Page | Project-8 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technologies-HTML--CSS-orange)

Hello There,

I'm `Adnan Sarkar`. This is the 8th assignment in my [Full Stack Javascript](https://ineuron.ai/course/Full-Stack-Javascript-Web-Developer) course. Where I designed this page using raw HTML & CSS. This design is responsive and I use for it only media queries. Now, I'm strongly confident to do any website responsive with raw HTML-CSS without using any framework.
